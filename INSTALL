Installation Instructions
=========================

   sboui uses a combination of CMake and Makefiles to build and install. CMake
   is responsible for determining system-dependent parameters, such as locating
   and testing the compiler and required libraries. It then generates Makefiles,
   which are scripts that build (by invoking the compiler and linker) and
   install the software. A basic workflow for building and installing is as
   follows:

   cd /path/to/sboui/top/dir
   mkdir build
   cd build
     cmake ..
     make
     make install
   cd ..
   
    x86_64 build   
   cd /path/to/sboui/top/dir
   mkdir build
   cd build
     cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING= -2 -fPIC .. 
     make
     make install
   cd ..

   This process compile the software in the /path/to/sboui/top/dir/build
   directory and install it to the default install path (root privileges may be
   needed for the install step). Some influential variables that may be passed
   to the cmake command include:

   * CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER      (name of compiler executable)
   * CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX    (location to install)
   * CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE        (typically "Release" or "Debug")
   * LIBCONFIG++_INCLUDE_DIR (location of libconfig++.h header file)
   * LIBCONFIG++_LIBRARY     (full path to libconfig++ library)

   Other variables are available as well. They can be viewed by navigating to
   the build directory, running `cmake` to set up the build, and then running
   `ccmake ..`. Any of these variables can be defined by passing them as options
   to CMake as follows:

   cmake \
     -D{variable1 name}={variable1 value} \
     -D{variable2 name}={variable2 value} \
     (etc) \
     ..

   where {variableX name} and {variableX value} are substituted by the actual
   names and values. String values are typically enclosed in quotes.

   Note that the libconfig++ library is required, and the `cmake` command will
   fail if it is not present. The project website for libconfig++ is:

   http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/

   If libconfig++ is not installed in standard system paths (e.g., /usr/include
   for the header file and /usr/lib for the library), you may set the variables
   LIBCONFIG++_INCLUDE_DIR and LIBCONFIG++_LIBRARY.

   By default, the sboui's configuration file, called sboui.conf, will always be
   installed in /etc/sboui, because that is where the program expects it to be.
   To override this location, set the CONFDIR variable as desired.
