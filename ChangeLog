        version 2.0
        * Implement a menu bar
        * Add full mouse support
        * Implement "buttons" on all dialog boxes
        * Add a desktop launcher file
        * Make built-in package manager (sboui-backend) the default
        * Implement upgrade all action (shortcut that filters by upgradable,
          tags all, and then upgrades tagged)
        * Implement clear tags action
        * New command line options: --sync, --upgrade-all, and --upgradable
        * Startup speed improvements (multi-threading, more efficient search
          in list item properties)
        * Include 1/4 page buffer when scrolling up and down in lists
        * More reliable arrow drawing (requires UTF-8)
        * Add About and mouse bindings dialogs (under Help in menu bar)
        * Some refactoring to minimize code duplication
        * Minor changes to color themes to work better with the menu bar
        * Fix a segfault occurring if repo_dir existed but was not valid
        * Fix a minor highlighting / redraw issue with right pane
        * Fix bug in sboui-backend when $OUTPUT is not /tmp
        * Remove TMPDIR config variable for sboui-backend; use $TMP environment
          variable instead to be consistent with SlackBuild scripts.
        * Some other minor improvements and fixes

        version 1.1
        * Remove editor setting. Use the PAGER environment variable for viewing
          READMEs and VISUAL or EDITOR for the Browse files function. less and
          vi are the defaults if these environment variables are not set.
        * Solve a flickering issue that was especially apparent in tmux and the
          console
        * Add reinstall_cmd so that an installed package does not need to be
          removed first before reinstalling. For most package managers, this is
          the same as install_cmd and upgrade_cmd, but sbotools uses unique
          commands for both. sbotools will also currently ask for confirmation
          when running the reinstall command, but there's nothing that can be
          done about that from sboui's end.
        * Improve checking for unknown file types; allows sboui to work when
          repo_dir is mounted via sshfs, and may fix problems with other
          filesystems as well
        * Switch to wget in sboui-backend (instead of curl)

2018-01-28   Daniel Prosser <dpross1100@msn.com>

        version 1.0
        * Add built-in package manager, sboui-backend
        * In OptionsWindow, display a dialog asking whether to automatically
          set default repo_dir, sync_cmd, install_cmd, and upgrade_cmd when
          switching package managers
        * Prompt user to sync the repo after repo_dir is changed
        * Add option to not warn about installed packages with invalid names
        * Fix default repo_dir for sbopkg when none is specified in the conf
          file
        * Fix PgDn scrolling bug where highlight could be above the visible
          list in rare circumstances
        * Allow color theme files to be symbolic links
        * Add new color themes: green and red
        * Add comments to ~/.sboui.conf written by sboui at runtime
        * When upgrading a package and rebuild_inv_deps, print number of
          inverse dependencies as well as dependencies in status message

2017-12-18   Daniel Prosser <dpross1100@msn.com>

        version 0.6
        * Check for changes in BUILD number as well as version number when
          determining whether a package is upgradable.
        * Improve check for whether version number has _$KERNEL version tag
          (needed when checking for upgradable packages).
        * Remember settings changes made by the user through the Options window
          across sessions. This is done by overwriting ~/.sboui.conf.
        * Optionally save build options for SlackBuilds and read them at startup
          so that they persist across sessions. This is the new default
          behavior. Set save_buildopts = false to disable this feature.
        * Mark SlackBuilds that have build options set with an asterisk.
        * Add a filter for SlackBuilds with build options set.
        * Add "cyan" color theme.
        * Fix segfault that could occur when removing dependencies of a package
          but some were already removed.

2017-11-13   Daniel Prosser <dpross1100@msn.com>

        version 0.5.1
        * Mark inverse deps for upgrade instead of reinstall as appropriate when
          rebuild_inv_deps = true

2017-10-30   Daniel Prosser <dpross1100@msn.com>

        version 0.5
        * Add option to rebuild inverse deps when upgrading a package
        * Fix upgrade check logic for WireGuard
        * Change color_theme='default' setting to 'default (dark)' in sboui.conf

2017-07-14   Daniel Prosser <dpross1100@msn.com>

        version 0.4.2
        * Color themes are now read automatically from /usr/share/sboui/themes
          and ~/.local/share/sboui/themes. The color_theme_file input has been
          removed.
        * Color themes now require one additional variable: theme_name
        * Build options are now entered one per line in the build options dialog
          box.
        * UX improvement: don't display whitespace at the end of a text input
          box unless it is needed for the cursor.
        * Bug fix: show information for correct SlackBuild in the status bar
          after tagging.

2017-06-08   Daniel Prosser <dpross1100@msn.com>

        version 0.4.1
        * Update ChangeLog and TODO, which were overlooked in 0.4

2017-06-08   Daniel Prosser <dpross1100@msn.com>

        version 0.4
        * Preserve selection as closely as possible after installing, upgrading,
          etc.
        * Allow browsing files in subdirectories
        * Ability to view README, browse files, set build options, and show
          package info for dependencies in InstallBox and BuildOrderBox 
        * Improve upgrade algorithm (use strict != criterion, but override this
          logic for SlackBuilds that append a tag to the version name)
        * Show an error message after syncing if the sync_cmd returns non-zero
        * Put information about dependency (libconfig) in README.md

2017-05-11   Daniel Prosser <dpross1100@msn.com>

        version 0.3.1
        * Fix a couple minor inconsistencies in documentation.
        * Change error reporting information in usage output.

2017-04-30   Daniel Prosser <dpross1100@msn.com>

        version 0.3

          packages installed from a different repo
        * Add a "Blacklisted" filter
        * Remove blacklisted packages from upgradable filter
        * Make a position notifier on the right side when scrolling in lists
          and input boxes
        * Add "quick search" function to jump in active list while typing
        * Add build options parameter applying to each SlackBuild; set by
          selecting appropriate choice in actions dialog (previously, needed to
          use global install_vars and upgrade_vars for build options)
        * Add option to search in READMEs
        * Add "Show package info" action
        * Smarter checks for whether changes were actually applied, and try
          reinstall if upgrade fails without giving an error
        * Add a "view command line output" command
        * Re-display actions dialog after install/upgrade/reinstall/reinstall
        * Support tagging in InstallBox
        * Various bug fixes and UX improvements

2017-04-17   Daniel Prosser <dpross1100@msn.com>

        version 0.2.1
        * Don't warn about skipping dependencies unless actually installing the
          package
        * Actually close .info file in ShellReader::close() (had no noticeable
          effect in use)
        * Check for and warn about invalid installed package names (previously
          would segfault) 
        * Check for and warn about missing .info files when encountered
        * Better check for upgradable pacakges. A package is considered
          upgradable if installed_version != upgradable_version, except when
          the only difference is a trailing tag starting with an underscore in
          installed_version (some packages for kernel modules are like this). 
          Previously, anything after the available_version text was considered
          a tag, even if it didn't begin with an underscore.
        * Restore original selection after pressing Esc in ComboBoxes.

2017-04-10   Daniel Prosser <dpross1100@msn.com>

        * Show installed packages from the repo even if they have different tag
        * Remove sboutil.sh shell script and implement its functions in C++
        * More efficient internal search through SlackBuilds lists
        * More efficient internal sorting algorithm
        * Add color pair for (tagged, bg_popup) -- was missing previously
        * Fix a bug in CMake module that checks for libconfig++
        * Add "commander" color theme
        * Render pipes in info displays as vertical lines
        * Allow message boxes to handle newlines
        * Improve sizing logic for message boxes
        * Add information message boxes (not just errors and warnings)
        * Warn about changing packages installed from different repository
        * Change "Help" to "Keys" in main window info
        * Clarify some entries in the keyboard shortcuts window

        * Display a message after successfully changing settings
        * Show a message + summary instead of pausing after installing, etc.
        * Reinstall by removing then installing again (needed for sbotools)
        * Add skip / cancel options when applying tags
        * Make tagged items and hotkeys visible when color is disabled
        * Always pause after syncing instead of showing a message box
          (because sbopkg and sbotools don't exit with error on sync failure)
        * Give a more useful error message when reading repo fails
        * Add standard repo_dir location for sbotools as comment in sboui.conf
        * Don't re-read the entire repository after install, upgrade, etc.
