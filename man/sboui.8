.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sboui
is a package management tool for SlackBuilds.org (SBo).
It features an ncurses user interface that combines the user-friendliness typically found in a GUI with the efficiency, light weight, and portability of a text interface.
It can function as a stand-alone package manager or serve as a front-end to
.BR sbopkg ,
.BR sbotools ,
or custom SBo package managers.
Its main features include:
.IP \(bu
Efficient operation with the keyboard, and full mouse support
.IP \(bu
Forward and inverse dependency resolution
.IP \(bu
Automatic rebuilding of inverse dependencies (optional)
.IP \(bu
Blacklisting
.IP \(bu
Ignoring specific versions of SlackBuilds when upgrading
.IP \(bu
Storing build options for individual SlackBuild scripts
.IP \(bu
"Tagging" to operate on multiple SlackBuilds
.IP \(bu
Searching the repository by name or by content in READMEs
.IP \(bu
A menu bar, buttons, drop-downs, and other elements typically found in a GUI
.IP \(bu
For desktop users, a system tray notifier for SBo updates (optional) and a .desktop file
.PP
.B Instructions
.PP
If the built-in package manager is not going to be used, a package manager such as
.BR sbopkg ,
.BR sbotools ,
or a custom tool must be installed.
.B sboui
also requires a configuration file,
.I /etc/sboui/sboui.conf
(the system-wide default) or
.I ~/.sboui.conf
(per-user override of the system-wide default).
The initial install will provide the former, while upgrades will add
.I /etc/sboui/sboui.conf.new
that the user can choose to merge with or replace the original.
See
.BR sboui.conf (5)
for more information about the configuration file.
Note also that all options can be changed interactively in the Options window, and doing so will overwrite
.IR ~/.sboui.conf .
.PP
.B sboui
can be operated most efficiently with the keyboard.
See the Help menu for a full list of shortcuts.
Full mouse support is also implemented for those who prefer to use the mouse.
To switch the active pane, use the
.I Tab
key or the
.I Right
and
.I Left
arrow keys.
Use the
.I Up
and
.I Down
arrow keys,
.IR Home ,
.IR End ,
.IR PgUp ,
and 
.I PgDn
to navigate lists and dialog boxes.
When the right (or bottom, if using the vertical layout) list is active, press
.I Enter
or double-click to display possible actions for the highlighted software package.
The
.I q 
key quits the program.
Please see the Operation section in README.md for more information on typical workflows.

.I /etc/sboui/sboui.conf
or
.IR ~/.sboui.conf .

.TP
.BR \-v ", " \-\-version
.br

.SH EXIT STATUS
The exit status is 0 if the command line options are valid and the configuration file was successfully read.
If invalid command line options are specified, the configuration file could not be read, or the configuration file contains errors, the exit status is 1.
Other errors that can occur during execution (e.g., a build failure for a package) are indicated to the user but do not affect the exit status.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B PAGER
.br
Application used to view READMEs.
.B less
is used as the default if this environment variable is not set.
.TP
\fBVISUAL\fR or \fBEDITOR\fR
.br
Application to edit files using the Browse files and View/edit notes functions.
VISUAL is checked first.
If it is unset, EDITOR is used instead.
.B vi
is used as the default if neither variable is set.
.SH FILES
.TP
.I /etc/sboui/sboui.conf
.br
System-wide configuration file for
.BR sboui .
See
.BR sboui.conf (5)
for more information about the entries in this file.
.TP
.I ~/.sboui.conf
.br
Per-user override of
.IR /etc/sboui/sboui.conf .
Note: this file is overwritten when settings are changed in the Options window of the user interface.
.TP
.I /etc/sboui/blacklist
.br
File used to blacklist packages or SlackBuilds.
Installed packages are searched for matches in the app name, version, arch, build, and complete package name against all patterns listed in this file.
In addition to installed packages, any SlackBuild matching an entry in the blacklist by name will also be marked.
Regex patterns are allowed.
.IP
The blacklist file prevents software from being installed, upgraded, reinstalled, or removed by sboui.
These four actions will not be available for blacklisted items.
Blacklisted packages will also be excluded from the Upgradable filter and included in the Blacklisted filter.
.TP
.I /etc/sboui/sboui-backend.conf
.br
Configuration file for the built-in package manager,
.BR sboui-backend .
See
.BR sboui-backend (8)
and
.BR sboui-backend.conf (5)
for more information.
.TP
.I /etc/sboui/ignore_versions
.br
File used to specify versions of SlackBuilds to ignore when checking for upgrades.
This feature is useful, for example, if you have upgraded a SlackBuild beyond the version available on SlackBuilds.org, and you don't want
.BR sboui
to show it as upgradable, because that would actually be a downgrade.
The file contains name:version pairs, one per line.
The same SlackBuild name can be listed more than once, paired with different versions, to ignore more than one version.
.TP
Color theme files
.br
Files defining colors for different UI elements.
System color themes are stored in
.IR /usr/share/sboui/themes .
Users can also add their own color themes in
.IR $HOME/.local/share/sboui/themes.
If not present, default color settings will be used.
See
.BR sboui.conf (5)
for more information about changing color settings.
.TP
Build options files
.br
Files containing build options for SlackBuilds.
There is one file per SlackBuild, with the naming convention {SlackBuild name}.buildopts.
They are stored in
.IR /var/lib/sboui/buildopts .
These files are automatically created by
.B sboui
when build options are set through the user interface and
.B save_buildopts
is enabled, but they can also be created manually if desired.
