# This file lists versions of SlackBuilds to ignore when checking which are
# upgradable. This can be useful if you have upgraded a SlackBuild beyond the
# version on SlackBuilds.org and don't want it to be tagged as upgradable.
# Multiple versions can be listed for a single SlackBuild if desired.
# e.g.:
#jdk11:11.0.22
#jdk11:11.0.23
#libreoffice:24.2.5
